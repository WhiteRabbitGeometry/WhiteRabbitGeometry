- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhiteRabbitGeometry
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes on github. I've always been told I should code but never got past the first chapter of C+. I know Html4 and some CSS, but for the most part I'm a coding noob. I do however have a background in philosophy and neuroscience, as well as degrees in scientific application and instruction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on A.I. and coding projects.
- 📫 How to reach me WhiteRabbitGeometry@gmail.com, or through any social channel @WhiteRabbitGeometry.
